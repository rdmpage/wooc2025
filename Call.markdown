##  Author guidelines
- Word Count: Ensure your abstract stays within the specified limit of 1250–1500 words (including references).
- Structure: Start with the full title of your abstract, followed immediately by the names and affiliations of all authors. Organize the content into clear sections, for instance: “Purpose”, “Methods”, “Results”, and “Value” to provide a logical and coherent flow of information.
- Language: Write in English (either US or UK spelling is acceptable). Use clear, concise language to present your work, and ensure the text is free from grammatical errors and typos before submission.
- References: References can be included to provide context or support for the findings. All references must adhere to APA style.
